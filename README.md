Single-Threaded, Multi-Threaded, and Thread Pool Server Implementations in Java
I developed a set of server implementations in Java, focusing on efficient request handling using threading models:

Single-Threaded Server:

A simple server where a single thread sequentially handles incoming requests.
This approach is straightforward but can become inefficient under heavy loads, as each request must wait for the previous one to complete.
Ideal for basic scenarios or learning purposes where concurrency isn't critical.
Multi-Threaded Server:

Designed to handle multiple requests simultaneously by spawning a new thread for each incoming client request.
This improves performance compared to the single-threaded approach but may lead to high memory usage and thread management overhead for large numbers of clients.
Thread Pool Server:

Implemented using Java's ExecutorService and ThreadPoolExecutor.
Efficiently manages a fixed pool of threads to handle multiple requests concurrently while avoiding the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly.
This model provides a scalable and efficient solution by limiting resource consumption and balancing load across threads.
